# Competitive programming in Haskell
Author of this repository spent some time solving competitive programming problems in Haskell and decided to create a little library that would cover algorithms and data structures which are often used in competitive programming.

# Contents of this repository
Every source file here contains implementation of some algorithm/data structure with a short description and a solution of some problem using the algorithm/data structure. For convenience every file contains
```haskell
-- End cut here.
-- Problem name
```
comment to make it easier to copy-paste. Before this comment a file contains only implementation of an algorithm/data structure and after the comment it contains code specific to problem's solution.

# But why?
Why not?

# No seriously why?
It turned out Haskell is quite convenient for solving competitive programming problems, but there are lots of things that are not implemented in Haskell or have implementations which are not suitable for competitive programming (too general, is a part of some huge library), the goal of this repository is to make it easier to use Haskell at programming contests.
